No plot could be more romantic than this one: A kind and virtuous Beauty offers herself as a hostage to free her father from the castle of a fearsome Beast. When she falls in love with the Beast despite his outward appearance, he's transformed into a handsome Prince. Who among us has not felt unworthy of a lover yet longed to have our inner value recognized? Who has not dreamed of romantic love with the power to redeem and transform? No wonder "Beauty and the Beast," originally a French story, is the second most frequently visited fairy tales for kids on Sur La Lune Fairy Tales.

Of all the many retellings, our favorite is probably French director Jean Cocteau's surreal 1945 film version La Belle et la BÃªte, but the Disney version is certainly the most prevalent (and lucrative). So far Beauty and the Beast has rung the company's cash register as a cartoon, a Broadway musical, a soundtrack album, and, most recently, a live-action film with Emma Watson. It's also spawned innumerable related merchandise items such as Disney's Enchanted Rose Jewelry Box, princess-pink sheet sets from Target emblazoned with the motto "Beauty is Found Within," and ornately cut gold foil B&B-inspired wedding invitations from an Etsy store called Shimmering Ceremony. Did you know that you can even buy Disney wedding gowns?
